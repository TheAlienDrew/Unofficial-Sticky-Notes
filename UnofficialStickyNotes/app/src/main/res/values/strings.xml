    <string name="popupInfo"><b>If you want Microsoft to create a true standalone version of Sticky Notes as a separate app, please head to the <a href="https://www.change.org/standalone-sticky-notes-microsoft">petition</a> I created to make Sticky Notes a standalone app, and sign it.</b>
        \n\nThis app is open-sourced, so if you know how to code and want to help, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/Unofficial-Sticky-Notes">Unofficial Sticky Notes GitHub</a> page.
        \n\n<b><u>Features</u>:</b>
        \n<li>Toggle between light, dark, and system themes via the volume keys.</li>
        \n<li>Works offline, but you must sign into it at least once, for the notes to show up on your device.</li>
        \n<li>Pull-to-refresh is enabled within the notes list.</li>
        \n\n<b><u>Noticed Bugs</u>:</b>
        \n<li>Autocorrect and predictive text features enter text incorrectly, so temporarily they are turned off while using this app. On Gboard, this happens to disable glide typing, while SwiftKey still enables it, BUT if you try to use it, it fails just like the text input bug I was talking about.</li>
        \n<li>Android 10 devices currently can\'t use camera to upload pictures directly in app (Google\'s fault), and I don\'t know when it will be fixed.</li>
        \n\n<b><u>Planned Features</u>:</b>
        \n<li>App menu/info button</li>
        \n<li>Undo/redo buttons when editing notes.</li>
        \n<li>Widgets for single notes (these won\'t be able to sync automatically).</li>
