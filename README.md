# Microsoft-Sticky-Notes
Because MS is pesky, I created the sticky notes app standalone (free, no ads, open-source)

This app if currently an unofficial project.

You can download the app from 4 locations so far:
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aliendrew.ms.stickynotes) (name change to unofficial in progress)
* Amazon Apps (App Submission Under Review)
* [Aptoide](https://aliendrew-stickynotes.en.aptoide.com/?store_name=aliendrew) 
* [GetJar](https://www.getjar.mobi/mobile/971813/Microsoft-Sticky-Notes-Unofficial) (Under review)

DISCLAIMER: I, and this app, are in no way affiliated with Microsoft, nor endorsed by the company.

Ever find yourself needing to use the Sticky Notes app that you use on your Windows 10? And maybe you use the syncing feature to take a look at those same notes on the web. However, there was quite some time where one could just use the OneNote app to see their own Sticky Notes, but for reasons, they decided to move that to the Microsoft Launcher. For that very reason, I decided to create this web based app for those that don't want to use the Microsoft Launcher when they only need access to their notes.

Perks so far:
* Includes a toggle between a light and dark theme
* No ADs (for obvious reasons)
* Open-source! https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/Microsoft-Sticky-Notes
