# Unofficial-Sticky-Notes
Because MS is pesky, I created the sticky notes app standalone (free, no ads, open-source)

You can download the app from 3+ locations so far:
* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=aliendrew.ms.stickynotes)
* [Amazon Apps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLK8KVC/ref=apps_sf_sta)
* [Aptoide](https://aliendrew-stickynotes.en.aptoide.com/?store_name=aliendrew)

And any Google Play mirrors, such as, but not limited to, APKPure.

If you'd like to download an older version of the app, all the way to the first version (I don't know why you would), they are located [here](https://aliendrew-stickynotes.en.aptoide.com/versions).

--- **App Description** ---

DISCLAIMER: I, and this app, are in no way affiliated with Microsoft.

Ever find yourself needing to use the Sticky Notes app that you use on your Windows 10? And maybe you use the syncing feature to take a look at those same notes on the web. There was, and still is the ability to use Sticky Notes in Microsoft's OneNote app, but for certain devices, such as tablets, that option is not available. The only other way to use Sticky Notes from that point is to use the Microsoft Launcher, but not everyone uses that. For that very reason, I decided to create this web based app for those that can't use Microsoft OneNote, and don't want to use Microsoft Launcher.

Perks so far:
* Dark theme to compliment the default light theme
* No ADs (for obvious reasons)
* Open-source! https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/Unofficial-Sticky-Notes

To activate the dark theme, press the volume down key. To go back to the light theme, press the volume up key. Or if you can't use the volume keys, you can press the back button to toggle through them.
